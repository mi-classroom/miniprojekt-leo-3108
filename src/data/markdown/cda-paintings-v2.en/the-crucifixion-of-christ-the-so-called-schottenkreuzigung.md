description: "The panel depicts a crucifixion with many figures set in a rocky landscape. The cross, which occupies the centre of the painting consists of roughly worked tree trunks, the body of Christ is covered in blood and marked by wounds from the flagellation. The two thieves flank him either side to the left and the right.  The attendant figures are divided between two groups at the foot of the cross: to the left are the women in mourning and St John grouped around the Virgin and to the right is a group of flamboyantly dressed men on horseback. On the left edge of the painting there is a man in peasant clothing.\n\n[Karl Schütz, 2005]"

  text: "The painting depicts a many figured crucifixion set in a rocky landscape, the cross in the centre of the painting is made from crude logs, roughly worked, the figure of Christ is covered in blood and exhibits extensive wounds (stigmata). He is flanked to the left and right by the two thieves, both have also been crucified on crosses made using crude logs. The assistant figures at the bottom of the cross are divided into two groups, to the left the weeping women and the Virgin with St John, on the far left a peasant figure, to the right a group of three conspicuously dressed men on horseback: one with a moustache wearing a large white turban, and a white undergarment covered by a sleeveless yellow coat with a wide red collar and fastened with laces. The horseman to the right is wearing a cone shaped hat, with a broad rim folded up on one side, a black coat with a fur collar and long, loose-hanging sleeves. The expressive style of the figures equates to the depiction of the landscape with rocky cliffs and tousled and bare trees. \nThe depiction of the Crucifixion differs in format but above all in type from earlier and contemporary late gothic painted versions, as it is not part of a cycle but rather an altarpiece. This raises the question of its original function, possibly as small retable, devotional or private image[1].\nThe painting, formerly in the collection of the Viennese Scottish Foundation, had until 1904 been attributed to Lucas van Leyden, and was identified by Friedrich Dörnhöffer as one of the earliest known works by Lucas Cranach and dated to 1500.[2] It was thus positioned on the pinnacle of Cranach's early work, which since the mid 19th century has gradually been identified as stylistically belonging together and by one artist.[3] It was above all the exhibition in Dresden in 1899, which played a key role in this research.[4]\nAt the same time it was realized that this stylistically coherent body of work - partially panel paintings of on the one hand Christian subject matter on the other hand portraits of Viennese humanists and partially woodcuts which radically differ from the late gothic works by other contemporary artists and indeed his own later works - was produced during Cranach's stay in Vienna.[5]\nFriedländer (1932)[6] was the first to attempt a chronology of the early works created in Vienna. He put the Crucifixion in first position before two woodcuts, which also depict the crucifixion, one of which bears the date 1502. According to Friedländer the drawing in the panel seems more tentative and more undecided than that of the woodcut from 1502 and may be of an earlier date. \nArt historical research has attempted to explain Cranach's artistic origin and the style of his early work. To this purpose reference has been made on the one hand to Albrecht Dürer's woodcut cycles from before 1500, especially the Apokalypse[7] and on the other hand to local artists in Franken, Bavaria and Austria, like the old Bavarian painter Jan Polack[8], whose paintings show similarly distorted and horrible head types and the Bamberg Master of the Hersbruck Panels[9]. Works of art from the artist's immediate vicinity  were also influential like a stone sculpture of St John the Baptist from 1498 by the otherwise unknown Hans Hart(lin) on the fasade of Kronach's town church[10], Pacher's pupil Marx Reichlich and finally the altarpieces by JörgBreu d. Ä, a contemporary painter from Augsburg, working in Austria[11]\nCrucial therefore is, amongst others, the question of where Cranach worked before his stay from 1501/1502 in Vienna. As early as 1899 Flechsig[12] assumed that Cranach must have spent time in Budapest on the grounds of a strangely clothed horseman, which he thought to be Hungarian, in one of the early woodcuts of the crucifixion. The Hungarian looking clothing of the horseman in the Viennese Crucifixion was an additional reason. A document appeared to support this theory. It was assumed that Lucas Cranach may have been related to the Kronacher family who can be traced both in Ofen and Vienna.[13] Johannes Kirchhaimer, 1458 and 61 Dean of the medical faculty at the University of Vienna was with respect to the conflict of 1462/63 between King Friedrich III and his brother the Archduke Albrecht one of Albrecht's leading followers. For this reason he had to leave Viennaduring the reign of Friedrich III and settle in Ofen. There one of his daughters married Albrecht Kronacher, citizen of Ofen, about whom nothing further is known. Albrecht's son, Ulrich Kronacher, returned to Vienna and reclaimed his mother's house; from 1511 he is mentioned as citizen and house owner/landlord in Vienna.\nAnzelewsky questions this line of argumentation.[14] It is impossible to draw conclusions from the mere concurrence of names and the eastern European costume in both the crucifixion woodcuts and the crucifixion panel are polish and not Hungarian. Anzelewsky draws a comparison with the clothes of the soldier in the depiction of the battle of Orsza (Warsaw, NationalMuseum) [15] by an unknown artist (recently attributed to Hans Krell[16]), the minatures in the Behaim-Codex, and similar costumes in the Adoration of the Magi (Berlin, Gemäldegalerie) by Hans Süß von Kulmbach and which was probably painted in Krakau.\nAnzelewsky concludes that before Cranach went to Vienna he must have been in Krakau between 1498 and 1502. Incidentally, similar to Vienna and later Wittenberg, Krakau was a princely residence with a university, which probably offered the artist good prospects. In contrast with the stagnant mannerist style, which had been passed down in the artisan tradition of the late gothic through generations of workshops and their apprentices, the young Cranach's new individual style was suited/appropriate for the quick blossoming Viennese Humanism around 1500.[17] In fact Cranach was in close relations with the main representatives. He made woodcuts for the printer Johannes Winterburger who had been in Vienna since 1493,[18] for Johannes Fuchsmagen he drew monthly depictions after a Filocalus manuscript from late antiquity[19] and he painted a depiction of St Jerome in the desert in 1502[20], which was formerly thought to have been commissioned by Johannes Cuspinian. A drawing of the sculpture 'The Youth of Magdalensberg' which had been discovered in 1502 indicates, just as the copies of manuscripts from late antiquity, the antiquarian interest s of a learned client.[21] Around 1502 he painted portraits of both the humanist Cuspinian and his wife Anna Putsch,[22] in 1503 he painted a further portrait pair of a humanist (in the past wrongly held to be a portrait of the lawyer Stephan Reuss, several times dean of the faculty of law and 1504 rector of the university.) and his wife in a landscape, which equals in appearance and artistic quality the Cuspinian portrait pair.[23] \nIt has been accepted to begin the Danube school with Cranach's early work.  However this term cannot contribute to the explanation of the stylistic phenomenon and its genesis, as has frequently been critically remarked in more recent times.[24] Indisputable is however the fact that the works of art created in Vienna between 1501 and 1503/04 by Cranach are the first manifestation of this new style, which was a few years later embodied in the work of Altdorfer.[Karl Schütz 2005, translated by Smith, cda]\n \n[1]Heiser 2002, 88ff.\n[2] Dörnhöffer 1904, 175\n[3] Bierende 2002, 16 and 21\n[4] Deutsche Kunst-Ausstellung Dresden 1899, Abteilung Cranach-Ausstellung, K.
