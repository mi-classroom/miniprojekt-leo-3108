description: "The painting depicts Lucretia as a full-length, standing nude figure. \nLucretia's body is shown from the front and her leg is slightly bent. Her face is inclined to the right and she stares into the far distance. Her right hand is raised slightly and holds a long dagger pointed between her breasts. Lucretia elegantly holds a transparent veil in her left hand. It is draped over her right lower arm and covers her vulva. However it is not hidden by the transparency of the veil. She does not wear any additional jewellery, but her hair is artistically pinned up. \nAlthough the background is dark and neutral Lucretia stands on stony ground. \n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]"
