description: "The fragment depicts Lucretia turned slightly to the left with her head inclined and her gaze directed towards the viewer.  A fur-trimmed coat covers her naked upper body and her blond curls are pinned up under a pearl bonnet. She wears a necklace with pearls and precious stones. Beneath her breasts the tip of the dagger is visible. There is a curtain depicted in the background.\n[Herrschaft, CDA 2011]\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]"

  text: "The painting was altered on numerous occasions: the fragmentary condition of the painting is mentioned by Friedländer / Rosenberg. Therefore it must have been cropped before 1932. The fact that it is listed as Lucretia begs the question whether the overpaint covering her breast and the dagger was applied later (Fig., D. Koepplin Archive). A further illustration shows the painting after the overpaint was removed and bares a label from the Montreal Museum on the reverse, indicating that the treatment may have been carried out while the painting was in the Hosmer Pillow Vaughan Collection. \n[Herrschaft, CDA 2011]"

  text: "In this fragment only the tip of the dagger, which is Lucretia’s attribute has survived. Her pose - the head inclined to the left, the gaze fixed on the viewer, the fur- trimmed overcoat covering both shoulders, the arms which were originally lowered, the pearl necklace as well as the curtain in the background – suggests that this fragment was originally very similar to two other surviving Lucretia paintings by Lucas Cranach the Elder or his workshop (FR240D). A further fragmentary image by Lucas Cranach the Elder (FR240L) is also very similar.\n[Herrschaft, CDA 2011]"
