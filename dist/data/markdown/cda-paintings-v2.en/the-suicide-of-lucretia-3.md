description: "The painting depicts Lucretia in contemporary dress standing in front of a landscape. \nHer head is inclined slightly to the left and she stares into the far distance. Her hands are lowered and she holds the dagger with which she has already injured her breasts.\nLucretia wears a gold, contemporary dress with white puffed sleeves, which has slipped off her shoulders to reveal her breasts. To complement the dress she wears a linked chain and a neck lace, both of which are richly decorated with pearls. Her curled hair is also decorated with pearls and covered with a veil. The simplicity of the long dagger is contrasted by the precious jewellery.\nA mountainous landscape with a castle is visible in the background.\n\nAccording to the legend Lucretia lived in the 6th century BC and was the beautiful and virtuous wife of the roman Collatinus. The roman King's son - Sextus Tarquinius fell in love with her. During a stay in her house Sextus threatened to kill her and shame her honour if she did not surrender to him. After the rape Lucretia had her father and husband vow vengeance and then she stabbed herself. The event led to an uprising in which the royal family was overthrown and the Roman Empire became a Republic. \nDepictions of Lucretia who was seen as the epitomy of female virtue, chastity, fidelity and honour enjoyed great popularity, particularly in the 16th century. \n[Literature: Bierende 2002, Follak 2002, Livius 1909]"

  text: "This depiction of Lucretia is similar to the painting in Kassel (FR122). In both paintings Lucretia is represented wearing contemporary dress, holding a dagger in both hands and is shown in front of a landscape. The size is also very similar.\n[Herrschaft, CDA 2011]"
